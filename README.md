# Roblox Avatar Rotator
A lightweight system tray application that automatically rotates your Roblox avatar between preset outfits, to create the effect that your avatar changes every time you reload.

## Features
* **Stays in the background:** Runs silently in the system tray.
* **Easy use:** You can create outfits in the Roblox avatar creator to cycle through.
* **Custom Intervals:** You can set the rotation speed.
* **Minimal Resources:** Uses less than 40MB of RAM and virtually 0% CPU (could be optimized but I wrote ts in python).
* **Logging:** Built in logging for troubleshooting API requests.
